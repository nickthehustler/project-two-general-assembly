# My Wino Friends

## General Assembly WDI6

### April 29 2016

_Summary:_

Hello! This is my second app as a student at General Assembly.

_Technologies and Gems Used:_
* Rails 4.2.1
* PostgreSQL
* Bootstrap 3
* JQuery
* Paperclip - a ruby gem used to upload files
* Devise - a ruby gem used to manage user authentication and authorization
* AWS-SDK - a ruby gem used in interfacing with Amazon Web Services

_My Wino Friends:_
My Wino Friends is a social networking app that allows individuals to catalog and share their favorite wines.
My inspiration for this app actually came from Goodreads.com which is a social networking app that allows
book lovers to connect and share books. I didn't want to copy Goodreads but I did want to build a social networking
app for a community of people who were passionate around a particular topic or item. So, why not wine!
